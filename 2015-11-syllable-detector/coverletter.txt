Dear Dr. Lengauer,

Thank you for reviewing our presubmission inquiry (PCOMPBIOL-D-16-00635).

As you've seen, we have developed a piece of software that may be of
general interest to neuroscientists working in the zebra finch and
possibly other bird species: it allows precisely timed triggering of
other experimental apparatus in response to syllables during bird
song.  We've gone to some lengths to describe and characterise the
software's performance in detail, and to make the code useful to the
community, and everything will be made available under an open source
license.  Although a relevant experimental result is included, the
focus is on the technique, but the paper is too long for a Software
paper.  Therefore, we ask that it be considered as a Methods paper.

If accepted, before final submission, all code will be moved to the
Gardner Lab github repository and placed under an appropriate open
source license, final release versions generated, and DOIs created as
described in https://guides.github.com/activities/citable-code/ .  The
relevant datasets will be uploaded to one of your approved
repositories.  For now, in lieu of final release DOIs, we provide
links to our development repositories.  If you would like anything
else, such as access to the datasets for review, please contact me.

Thank you!
