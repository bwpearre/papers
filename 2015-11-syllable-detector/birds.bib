abstract ={Many animals exhibit flexible behaviors that they can adjust to increase reward or avoid harm (learning by positive or aversive reinforcement). But what neural mechanisms allow them to restore their original behavior (motor program) after reinforcement is withdrawn? One possibility is that motor restoration relies on brain areas that have a role in memorization but no role in either motor production or in sensory processing relevant for expressing the behavior and its refinement.We investigated the role of a higher auditory brain area in the songbird for modifying and restoring the stereotyped adult song. We exposed zebra finches to aversively reinforcing white noise stimuli contingent on the pitch of one of their stereotyped song syllables. In response, birds significantly changed the pitch of that syllable to avoid the aversive reinforcer. After we withdrew reinforcement, birds recovered their original song within a few days. However, we found that large bilateral lesions in the caudal medial nidopallium (NCM, a high auditory area) impaired recovery of the original pitch even several weeks after withdrawal of the reinforcing stimuli. Because NCM lesions spared both successful noise-avoidance behavior and birds' auditory discrimination ability, our results show that NCM is not needed for directed motor changes or for auditory discriminative processing, but is implied in memorizing or recalling the memory of the recent song target.},

abstract={The sliding DFT process for spectrum analysis was presented and shown to be more efficient than the popular Goertzel (1958) algorithm for sample-by-sample DFT bin computations. The sliding DFT provides computational advantages over the traditional DFT or FFT for many applications requiring successive output calculations, especially when only a subset of the DFT output bins are required. Methods for output stabilization as well as time-domain data windowing by means of frequency-domain convolution were also discussed. A modified sliding DFT algorithm, called the sliding Goertzel DFT, was proposed to further reduce the computational workload. We start our sliding DFT discussion by providing a review of the Goertzel algorithm and use its behavior as a yardstick to evaluate the performance of the sliding DFT technique. We examine stability issues regarding the sliding DFT implementation as well as review the process of frequency-domain convolution to accomplish time-domain windowing. Finally, a modified sliding DFT structure is proposed that provides improved computational efficiency.},
