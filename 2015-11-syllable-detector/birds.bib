  abstract = {Songbirds are capable of vocal learning and
                  communication, and are ideally suited to the study
                  of neural mechanisms of complex sensory and motor
                  processing. Vocal communication in a noisy bird
                  colony and vocal learning of a specific song
                  template both require the ability to monitor
                  auditory feedback to distinguish self-generated
                  vocalizations from external sounds and to identify
                  mismatches between the developing song and a
                  memorized template acquired from a tutor. However,
                  neurons that respond to auditory feedback from vocal
                  output have not been found in song-control areas
                  despite intensive searching. Here we
                  investigate feedback processing outside the
                  traditional song system, in single auditory
                  forebrain neurons of juvenile zebra finches that
                  were in a late developmental stage of song
                  learning. Overall, we found similarity of spike
                  responses during singing and during playback of the
                  bird's own song, with song responses commonly
                  leading by a few milliseconds. However, brief
                  time-locked acoustic perturbations of auditory
                  feedback revealed complex sensitivity that could not
                  be predicted from passive playback responses. Some
                  neurons that responded to playback perturbations did
                  not respond to song perturbations, which is
                  reminiscent of sensory-motor mirror neurons. By
                  contrast, some neurons were highly feedback
                  sensitive in that they responded vigorously to song
                  perturbations, but not to unperturbed songs or
                  perturbed playback. These findings suggest that a
                  computational function of forebrain auditory areas
                  may be to detect errors between actual feedback and
                  mirrored feedback deriving from an internal model of
                  the bird's own song or that of its tutor. Such
                  feedback-sensitive spikes could constitute the key
                  signals that trigger adaptive motor responses to
                  song disruptions or reinforce exploratory
                  motor gestures for vocal learning.}

abstract ={Many animals exhibit flexible behaviors that they can adjust to increase reward or avoid harm (learning by positive or aversive reinforcement). But what neural mechanisms allow them to restore their original behavior (motor program) after reinforcement is withdrawn? One possibility is that motor restoration relies on brain areas that have a role in memorization but no role in either motor production or in sensory processing relevant for expressing the behavior and its refinement.We investigated the role of a higher auditory brain area in the songbird for modifying and restoring the stereotyped adult song. We exposed zebra finches to aversively reinforcing white noise stimuli contingent on the pitch of one of their stereotyped song syllables. In response, birds significantly changed the pitch of that syllable to avoid the aversive reinforcer. After we withdrew reinforcement, birds recovered their original song within a few days. However, we found that large bilateral lesions in the caudal medial nidopallium (NCM, a high auditory area) impaired recovery of the original pitch even several weeks after withdrawal of the reinforcing stimuli. Because NCM lesions spared both successful noise-avoidance behavior and birds' auditory discrimination ability, our results show that NCM is not needed for directed motor changes or for auditory discriminative processing, but is implied in memorizing or recalling the memory of the recent song target.},

The sliding DFT provides computational advantages over the traditional DFT or FFT for many applications requiring successive output calculations, especially when only a subset of the DFT output bins are required. Methods for output stabilization as well as time-domain data windowing by means of frequency-domain convolution were also discussed. A modified sliding DFT algorithm, called the sliding Goertzel DFT, was proposed to further reduce the computational workload. We start our sliding DFT discussion by providing a review of the Goertzel algorithm and use its behavior as a yardstick to evaluate the performance of the sliding DFT technique. We examine stability issues regarding the sliding DFT implementation as well as review the process of frequency-domain convolution to accomplish time-domain windowing. Finally, a modified sliding DFT structure is proposed that provides improved computational efficiency.},

Further progress depends on a deeper insight into the mechanisms of action of DBS in the context of disturbed brain circuits. For this, optimized animal models have to be developed. We review not only charge transfer mechanisms at the electrode/tissue interface and strategies to increase the stimulation's energy-efficiency but also the electrochemical, electrophysiological, biochemical and functional effects of DBS. We introduce a hemi-Parkinsonian rat model for long-term experiments with chronically instrumented rats carrying a backpack stimulator and implanted platinum/iridium electrodes. This model is suitable for (1) elucidating the electrochemical processes at the electrode/tissue interface, (2) analyzing the molecular, cellular and behavioral stimulation effects, (3) testing new target regions for DBS, (4) screening for potential neuroprotective DBS effects, and (5) improving the efficacy and safety of the method.

  abstract = {Background

Over the last two decades, deep brain stimulation (DBS) has become a recognized and effective clinical therapy for numerous neurologic conditions. Since its inception, clinical DBS technology has progressed at a relatively slow rate; however, numerous advances in neural engineering research have the potential to improve DBS systems. One such advance is the concept of current steering, or the use of multiple stimulation sources to direct current flow through targeted regions of brain tissue. The goals of this study were to develop a theoretical understanding of the effects of current steering in the context of DBS, and use that information to evaluate the potential use of current steering during stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus.
Methods

We used finite element electric field models, coupled to multicompartment cable axon models, to predict the volume of tissue activated (VTA) by DBS as a function of the stimulation parameter settings.
Results

Balancing current flow through adjacent cathodes can increase the VTA magnitude, relative to monopolar stimulation, and current steering can be an effective technique to sculpt the shape of the VTA to fit a given anatomic target.
Conclusions

These results provide motivation for the integration of current steering technology into clinical DBS systems, thereby expanding opportunities to customize DBS to individual patients, and potentially enhancing therapeutic efficacy.}

  month =     {July},
  abstract = {Deep brain stimulation (DBS) has steadily evolved into an established surgical therapy for numerous neurological disorders, most notably Parkinson's disease (PD). Traditional DBS technology relies on voltage-controlled stimulation with a single source; however, recent engineering advances are providing current-controlled devices with multiple independent sources. These new stimulators deliver constant current to the brain tissue, irrespective of impedance changes that occur around the electrode, and enable more specific steering of current towards targeted regions of interest. In this study, we examined the impact of current steering between multiple electrode contacts to directly activate three distinct neural populations in the subthalamic region commonly stimulated for the treatment of PD: projection neurons of the subthalamic nucleus (STN), globus pallidus internus (GPi) fibers of the lenticular fasiculus, and internal capsule (IC) fibers of passage. We used three-dimensional finite element electric field models, along with detailed multicompartment cable models of the three neural populations to determine their activations using a wide range of stimulation parameter settings. Our results indicate that selective activation of neural populations largely depends on the location of the active electrode(s). Greater activation of the GPi and STN populations (without activating any side effect related IC fibers) was achieved by current steering with multiple independent sources, compared to a single current source. Despite this potential advantage, it remains to be seen if these theoretical predictions result in a measurable clinical effect that outweighs the added complexity of the expanded stimulation parameter search space generated by the more flexible technology.},

However, the exact mechanisms of action of DBS are still uncertain, although different theories have emerged. This review summarizes the current understanding in this field. Different modalities used to investigate DBS such as electrophysiological, imaging and biochemical studies have revealed different mechanisms of DBS. The mechanisms may also be different depending on the structure targeted, the disease condition or the animal model employed. DBS may inhibit the target neuronal networks but activate the efferent axons. It may suppress pathological rhythms or impose new rhythms associated with beneficial effects, and involves neuronal networks with widespread connections. Different neurotransmitter systems such as dopamine and GABA upregulation are involved in the effects of DBS. There are also technical advances to prolong the battery life and specific targeting based on new electrode designs with multiple contacts which have the ability to steer the current toward a specific direction. There is ongoing work in closed loop or adaptive DBS using neural oscillations to provide the feedback signals. These oscillations need to be better characterized in a wide variety of clinical settings in future studies. Individualization of DBS parameters based on neural oscillations may optimize the clinical benefits of DBS.},

  abstract = {Deep brain stimulation of different targets has been shown to drastically improve symptoms of a variety of neurological conditions. However, the occurrence of disabling side effects may limit the ability to deliver adequate amounts of current necessary to reach the maximal benefit. Computed models have suggested that reduction in electrode size and the ability to provide directional stimulation could increase the efficacy of such therapies. This has never been demonstrated in humans. In the present study, we assess the effect of directional stimulation compared to omnidirectional stimulation. Three different directions of stimulation as well as omnidirectional stimulation were tested intraoperatively in the subthalamic nucleus of 11 patients with Parkinson's disease and in the nucleus ventralis intermedius of two other subjects with essential tremor. At the trajectory chosen for implantation of the definitive electrode, we assessed the current threshold window between positive and side effects, defined as the therapeutic window. A computed finite element model was used to compare the volume of tissue activated when one directional electrode was stimulated, or in case of omnidirectional stimulation. All but one patient showed a benefit of directional stimulation compared to omnidirectional. A best direction of stimulation was observed in all the patients. The therapeutic window in the best direction was wider than the second best direction (P = 0.003) and wider than the third best direction (P = 0.002). Compared to omnidirectional direction, the therapeutic window in the best direction was 41.3\% wider (P = 0.037). The current threshold producing meaningful therapeutic effect in the best direction was 0.67 mA (0.3-1.0 mA) and was 43\% lower than in omnidirectional stimulation (P = 0.002). No complication as a result of insertion of the directional electrode or during testing was encountered. The computed model revealed a volume of tissue activated of 10.5 mm(3) in omnidirectional mode, compared with 4.2 mm(3) when only one electrode was used. Directional deep brain stimulation with a reduced electrode size applied intraoperatively in the subthalamic nucleus as well as in the nucleus ventralis intermedius of the thalamus significantly widened the therapeutic window and lowered the current needed for beneficial effects, compared to omnidirectional stimulation. The observed side effects related to direction of stimulation were consistent with the anatomical location of surrounding structures. This new approach opens the door to an improved deep brain stimulation therapy. Chronic implantation is further needed to confirm these findings.},

  abstract = {For over a century, electrical microstimulation has been the most direct method for causally linking brain function with behavior. Despite this long history, it is still unclear how the activity of neural populations is affected by stimulation. For example, there is still no consensus on where activated cells lie, or on the extent to which neural processes such as passing axons near the electrode are also activated. Past studies of this question have proven difficult because microstimulation interferes with electrophysiological recordings, which in any case provide only coarse information about the location of activated cells. We used two-photon calcium imaging, an optical method, to circumvent these hurdles. We found that microstimulation sparsely activates neurons around the electrode, sometimes as far as millimeters away, even at low currents. The pattern of activated neurons likely arises from the direct activation of axons in a volume with a diameter of tens of microns.}}

Methodology: We describe an assembly method for a 16 channel electrode array consisting of carbon fibers (<5 μm diameter) individually insulated with Parylene-C and fire-sharpened. The diameter of the array is approximately 26 microns, along the full extent of the implant.

Results: Carbon fiber arrays were tested in HVC (used as a proper name), a song motor nucleus, of singing zebra finches where individual neurons discharge with temporally precise patterns. Previous reports of activity in this population of neurons has required the use of high impedance electrodes on movable microdrives. Here, the carbon fiber electrodes provided stable multi-unit recordings over time-scales of months. Spike-sorting indicated that the multi-unit signals were dominated by one, or a small number of cells. Stable firing patterns during singing confirmed the stability of these clusters over time-scales of months. In addition, from a total of 10 surgeries, 16 projection neurons were found. This cell type is characterized by sparse - stereotyped firing firing patterns, providing unambiguous confirmation of single cell recordings.

Significance: Carbon fiber electrode bundles may provide a scalable solution for long-term neural recordings of densely packed neurons.}

An understanding of the electrochemical mechanisms underlying the behavior of neural stimulation and recording electrodes is important for the development of chronically implanted devices, particularly those employing large numbers of microelectrodes. For stimulation, materials that support charge injection by capacitive and faradaic mechanisms are available. These include titanium nitride, platinum, and iridium oxide, each with certain advantages and limitations. The use of charge-balanced waveforms and maximum electrochemical potential excursions as criteria for reversible charge injection with these electrode materials are described and critiqued. Techniques for characterizing electrochemical properties relevant to stimulation and recording are described with examples of differences in the in vitro and in vivo response of electrodes. }

  abstract = {Although simple in concept, reliable antidromic identification of efferent populations poses numerous technical challenges and is subject to a host of sampling biases, most of which select against the detection of the neurons with slowly conducting axons. This problem is particularly acute in studies of the neocortex. Many neocortical efferent systems have large sub-populations with very slowly conducting, nonmyelinated axons and these elements have been relatively neglected in antidromic studies of neocortical neurons. The present review attempts to redress this problem by analyzing the steps that must necessarily precede antidromic identification and the sampling biases associated with each of these steps. These steps include (1) initial recognition that the microelectrode is near a neuron; (2) activation of the efferent axon via the stimulating electrode; (3) conduction of the antidromic impulse from stimulation site to soma; (4) detection of the antidromic spike in the extracellular record and (5) discriminating antidromic from synaptic activation. Experimental strategies are suggested for minimizing the sampling biases associated with each of these steps; most of which can be reduced or eliminated by appropriate experimental procedures. Careful attention to such procedures will make it possible to better understand the nature and function of the information flow along the very slowly conducting axonal systems of the neocortex.},

In songbirds, one prominent site of pre-motor activity is the forebrain robust nucleus of the archistriatum (RA), which generates stereotyped sequences of spike bursts during song1 and recapitulates these sequences during sleep2. We show that the stereotyped sequences in RA are driven from nucleus HVC (high vocal centre), the principal pre-motor input to RA3, 4. Recordings of identified HVC neurons in sleeping and singing birds show that individual HVC neurons projecting onto RA neurons produce bursts sparsely, at a single, precise time during the RA sequence. These HVC neurons burst sequentially with respect to one another. We suggest that at each time in the RA sequence, the ensemble of active RA neurons is driven by a subpopulation of RA-projecting HVC neurons that is active only at that time. As a population, these HVC neurons may form an explicit representation of time in the sequence. Such a sparse representation, a temporal analogue of the 'grandmother cell'5 concept for object recognition, eliminates the problem of temporal interference during sequence generation and learning attributed to more distributed representations.},

Practical issues associated with achieving this include the paucity of human data related to disease states, poorly validated estimators of patient state, and unknown dynamic mappings of optimal stimulation parameters based on estimated states. To overcome these challenges, we present an investigational platform including: an implanted sensing and stimulation device to collect data and run automated closed-loop algorithms; an external tool to prototype classifier and control-policy algorithms; and real-time telemetry to update the implanted device firmware and monitor its state. The prototyping system was demonstrated in a chronic large animal model studying hippocampal dynamics. We used the platform to find biomarkers of the observed states and transfer functions of different stimulation amplitudes. Data showed that moderate levels of stimulation suppress hippocampal beta activity, while high levels of stimulation produce seizure-like after-discharge activity. The biomarker and transfer function observations were mapped into classifier and control-policy algorithms, which were downloaded to the implanted device to continuously titrate stimulation amplitude for the desired network effect. The platform is designed to be a flexible prototyping tool and could be used to develop improved mechanistic models and automated closed-loop systems for a variety of neurological disorders.},

This paper reviews the biological mechanisms, acquisition and analysis methodology of DTI measurements. The relationships between DTI measures and white matter pathologic features (ischemia, myelination, axonal damage, inflammation, and edema) are summarized. Applications of DTI to tissue characterization in neurotherapeutic applications are reviewed. The interpretations of common DTI measures – mean diffusivity (MD), fractional anisotropy (FA), radial diffusivity (Dr) and axial diffusivity (Da) – are discussed. In particular, FA is highly sensitive to microstructural changes, but not very specific to the type of changes (e.g., radial or axial). In order to maximize the specificity, it is recommended that future studies use multiple diffusion tensor measures (e.g., MD and FA, or Da and Dr) to better characterize the tissue microstructure.}

The limited spatial resolution of current devices results in indiscriminate stimulation of interleaved cells of different types, precluding veridical reproduction of natural activity patterns in the retinal output. Here we investigate the use of spatial patterns of current injection to increase the spatial resolution of stimulation, using high-density multielectrode recording and stimulation of identified ganglion cells in isolated macaque retina. As previously shown, current passed through a single electrode typically induced a single retinal ganglion cell spike with submillisecond timing precision. Current passed simultaneously through pairs of neighboring electrodes modified the probability of activation relative to injection through a single electrode. This modification could be accurately summarized by a piecewise linear model of current summation, consistent with a simple biophysical model based on multiple sites of activation. The generalizability of the piecewise linear model was tested by using the measured responses to stimulation with two electrodes to predict responses to stimulation with three electrodes. Finally, the model provided an accurate prediction of which among a set of spatial stimulation patterns maximized selective activation of a cell while minimizing activation of a neighboring cell. The results demonstrate that tailored multielectrode stimulation patterns based on a piecewise linear model may be useful in increasing the spatial resolution of retinal prostheses.}}

of communication, it is virtually unknown how information is transferred in local cortical networks, consisting of hundreds of closely
spaced neurons. To address this, it is important to record simultaneously from hundreds of neurons at a spacing that matches typical
axonal connection distances, and at a temporal resolution that matches synaptic delays. We used a 512-electrode array (60 $\mu$m spacing)
to record spontaneous activity at 20 kHz from up to 500 neurons simultaneously in slice cultures of mouse somatosensory cortex for 1 h
at a time. We applied a previously validated version of transfer entropy to quantify information transfer. Similar to
in vivo
reports,
we found an approximately lognormal distribution of firing rates. Pairwise information transfer strengths also were nearly
lognormally distributed, similar to reports of synaptic strengths. Some neurons transferred and received much more information
than others, which is consistent with previous predictions. Neurons with the highest outgoing and incoming information transfer
were more strongly connected to each other than chance, thus forming a “rich club.” We found similar results in networks recorded
in vivo
from rodent cortex, suggesting the generality of these findings. A rich-club structure has been found previously in
large-scale human brain networks and is thought to facilitate communication between cortical regions. The discovery of a small,
but information-rich, subset of neurons within cortical regions suggests that this population will play a vital role in communication, learning, and memory.}

Here, we present and test a closed-loop stimulation strategy for PD in the 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) primate model of PD. Application of pallidal closed-loop stimulation leads to dissociation between changes in basal ganglia (BG) discharge rates and patterns, providing insights into PD pathophysiology. Furthermore, cortico-pallidal closed-loop stimulation has a significantly greater effect on akinesia and on cortical and pallidal discharge patterns than standard open-loop DBS and matched control stimulation paradigms. Thus, closed-loop DBS paradigms, by modulating pathological oscillatory activity rather than the discharge rate of the BG-cortical networks, may afford more effective management of advanced PD. Such strategies have the potential to be effective in additional brain disorders in which a pathological neuronal discharge pattern can be recognized.}

advancements have an especially important role in
DBS, now becoming an increasingly more appealing
business given the growing Parkinson’s disease (PD)
prevalence—expected to reach 8.7 million in 2030

One of the limitations of the current technology is inconsistent performance in long-term applications. Although the brain tissue response is believed to be a major cause of performance degradation, the precise mechanisms that lead to failure of recordings are unknown. We observed persistent ED1 immunoreactivity around implanted silicon microelectrode arrays implanted in adult rat cortex that was accompanied by a significant reduction in nerve fiber density and nerve cell bodies in the tissue immediately surrounding the implanted silicon microelectrode arrays. Persistent ED1 up-regulation and neuronal loss was not observed in microelectrode stab controls indicating that the phenotype did not result from the initial mechanical trauma of electrode implantation, but was associated with the foreign body response. In addition, we found that explanted electrodes were covered with ED1/MAC-1 immunoreactive cells and that the cells released MCP-1 and TNF-alpha under serum-free conditions in vitro. Our findings suggest a potential new mechanism for chronic recording failure that involves neuronal cell loss, which we speculate is caused by chronic inflammation at the microelectrode brain tissue interface.}

Such arrays are implanted into the patient's cortical tissue and record extracellular potentials from nearby neurons, allowing the information encoded by the neuronal discharges to control external devices. While such systems perform well during acute recordings, they often fail to function reliably in clinically relevant chronic settings. Available evidence suggests that a major failure mode of electrode arrays is the brain tissue reaction against these implants, making the biocompatibility of implanted electrodes a primary concern in device design. This review presents the biological components and time course of the acute and chronic tissue reaction in brain tissue, analyses the brain tissue response of current electrode systems, and comments on the various material science and bioactive strategies undertaken by electrode designers to enhance electrode performance.}}

                  excitable tissues is essential for relating the
                  electromagnetic fields generated by the tissue to
                  the underlying electrophysiological currents.
                  Efforts to characterize these endogenous currents
                  from measurements of the associated electromagnetic
                  fields would significantly benefit from the ability
                  to measure the electrical conductivity properties of
                  the tissue noninvasively.  Here, using an effective
                  medium approach, we show how the electrical
                  conductivity tensor of tissue can be quantitatively
                  inferred from the water self-diffusion tensor as
                  measured by diffusion tensor magnetic resonance
                  imaging.  The effective medium model indicates a
                  strong linear relationship between the conductivity
                  and diffusion tensor eigenvalues (respectively, s
                  and d ) in agreement with theoretical bounds and
                  experimental measurements presented here ($\sigma / d \approx 0.844 \pm 0.0545 S\cdot s / mm^3, r^2 = 0.945$).  The
                  extension to other biological transport phenomena is
                  also discussed.}

  abstract = {In this study we employed a quantitative immunohistochemical approach to compare the brain tissue response to planar silicon microelectrode arrays that were conformally coated with Parylene-C to uncoated controls at 2, 4, and 12 weeks following implantation into the cortex of adult male Sprague-Dawley rats. We did not find any difference in the relative intensity or the spatial distribution of neuronal or glial markers over the indwelling period, even though Parylene-C-coated substrates supported significantly less cell attachment, indicating that the foreign body response to planar silicon microelectrode arrays has little to do with the composition or decomposition of the silicon electrode. Moreover, our results suggest that changes in microelectrode surface chemistry do not have a strong influence on the cytoarchitectural changes that accompany the brain foreign body response to planar silicon microelectrode arrays. Our quantitative comparison over the indwelling period does not support progressive increases in astrocyte encapsulation and/or progressive neuronal loss in the recording zone as dominant failure mechanisms of the type of chronic recording device. Finally, we found evidence of two potentially new failure mechanisms that were associated with CD68 immunoreactivity including demyelination of adjacent neurons and BBB breakdown surrounding implanted electrodes at long indwelling times.}

  abstract = {Deep brain stimulation (DBS) has been used as a treatment of movement disorders such as Parkinson's disease, dystonia, and essential tremor for over twenty years, and is a promising treatment for depression and epilepsy. However, the exact mechanisms of action of DBS are still uncertain, although different theories have emerged. This review summarizes the current understanding in this field. Different modalities used to investigate DBS such as electrophysiological, imaging and biochemical studies have revealed different mechanisms of DBS. The mechanisms may also be different depending on the structure targeted, the disease condition or the animal model employed. DBS may inhibit the target neuronal networks but activate the efferent axons. It may suppress pathological rhythms or impose new rhythms associated with beneficial effects, and involves neuronal networks with widespread connections. Different neurotransmitter systems such as dopamine and GABA upregulation are involved in the effects of DBS. There are also technical advances to prolong the battery life and specific targeting based on new electrode designs with multiple contacts which have the ability to steer the current toward a specific direction. There is ongoing work in closed loop or adaptive DBS using neural oscillations to provide the feedback signals. These oscillations need to be better characterized in a wide variety of clinical settings in future studies. Individualization of DBS parameters based on neural oscillations may optimize the clinical benefits of DBS.}
