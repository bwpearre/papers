  abstract = {Micromachines can be created with higher resolution using two-photon absorption. Compared with light or electron-beam lithography, the virtue of two-photon photopolymerization as a tool for making microdevices lies in its three-dimensional capability, which has found application in photonic devices and micromachines with feature sizes close to the diffraction limit. Here we show that the diffraction limit can be exceeded by non-linear effects to give a subdiffraction-limit spatial resolution of 120 nanometres.}}

  abstract = {Two-photon polymerization (2PP) using ultra-short laser pulses is a well-known methodology for the 3D free-form fabrica-tion of optical devices with resolutions down to 100 nm. However, the structure dimensions have been restricted to quite small sizes, mainly due to limitations of the focussing optics and due to very long fabrication times. Therefore, the large-scale fabrication of biomedical scaffold structures with dimensions in the mm-range still remains challenging. Using a diode-pumped Ytterbium laser system emitting 325 fs laser pulses at 515 nm after second harmonic generation we are able to write arbitrary 3D structures in inorganic-organic hybrid polymers (ORMOCERÂ®s). Our setup is able to produce structures with mm extension normal to the substrate at a structural resolution of a few microns. In particular, a 3D porous inner structure can be provided, which is required for three-dimensional cell growth to support cell adhesion and prolifera-tion. Scaffold stru ctures were produced with different parameters, and they were characterized in order to demonstrate their potential concerning resolution and scaffold quality. It is found that not only the experimental setup, but also the substrate material plays an important role for the scaffold fabrication process and structural quality.},

  abstract = {A resonant scanner control system controls a laser source using a pixel clock which uses a voltage controlled oscillator (VCO) and a phase detector to track continuously throughout the entire scan cycle the pixel-to-pixel and cycle-to-cycle operations of the scanner. The clock includes a VCO which changes frequency in a linear manner in response to changes in a frequency-control voltage applied to it. The VCO includes a negative feedback loop which consists of a frequency-to-voltage converter, which converts the VCO output to a related voltage, and a summing/integrating circuit, which compares this voltage with the frequency-control voltage which is produced in response to pixel related control signals and then integrates the difference. The integrated signal drives the VCO, which produces in response an output signal whose frequency varies linearly with variations in the pixel-related frequency-control signal. Once during each scan cycle the phase detector detects any phase error between a pixel-clock-driven synchronization signal and a position-related synchronization signal, which is produced by an optical detector. If the two synchronization signals do not coincide, the phase detector sends an appropriate analog error signal to a multiplying reference port of a multiplying digital/analog converter (DAC) which produces the pixel related frequency-control signal. The DAC then adjusts its frequency-control signal in accordance with the error signal.}
