  abstract = {Recent progress in intracellular calcium sensors and other fluorophores has promoted the widespread adoption of functional optical imaging in the life sciences. Home-built multiphoton microscopes are easy to build, highly customizable, and cost effective. For many imaging applications a 3-axis motorized stage is critical, but commercially available motorization hardware (motorized translators, controller boxes, etc) are often very expensive. Furthermore, the firmware on commercial motor controllers cannot easily be altered and is not usually designed with a microscope stage in mind. Here we describe an open-source motorization solution that is simple to construct, yet far cheaper and more customizable than commercial offerings. The cost of the controller and motorization hardware are under \$1000. Hardware costs are kept low by replacing linear actuators with high quality stepper motors. Electronics are assembled from commonly available hobby components, which are easy to work with. Here we describe assembly of the system and quantify the positioning accuracy of all three axes. We obtain positioning repeatability of the order of 1 um in X/Y and 0.1 um in Z. A hand-held control-pad allows the user to direct stage motion precisely over a wide range of speeds ($10^{-1}$ to $10^2$ um/s), rapidly store and return to different locations, and execute “jumps” of a fixed size. In addition, the system can be controlled from a PC serial port. Our “OpenStage” controller is sufficiently flexible that it could be used to drive other devices, such as micro-manipulators, with minimal modifications.},

  year =         2003,
  abstract = {BACKGROUND:
Laser scanning microscopy is a powerful tool for analyzing the structure and function of biological specimens. Although numerous commercial laser scanning microscopes exist, some of the more interesting and challenging applications demand custom design. A major impediment to custom design is the difficulty of building custom data acquisition hardware and writing the complex software required to run the laser scanning microscope.
RESULTS:
We describe a simple, software-based approach to operating a laser scanning microscope without the need for custom data acquisition hardware. Data acquisition and control of laser scanning are achieved through standard data acquisition boards. The entire burden of signal integration and image processing is placed on the CPU of the computer. We quantitate the effectiveness of our data acquisition and signal conditioning algorithm under a variety of conditions. We implement our approach in an open source software package (ScanImage) and describe its functionality.
CONCLUSIONS:
We present ScanImage, software to run a flexible laser scanning microscope that allows easy custom design.

Micrometric and sub-micrometric resolution hydrogel scaffolds are required to deeply investigate molecular mechanisms behind cell-matrix interaction and downstream cellular processes. We report the design and development of high resolution 3D gelatin hydrogel woodpile structures by two-photon crosslinking. Hydrated structures of lateral linewidth down to 0.5 µm, lateral and axial resolution down to a few µm are demonstrated. According to the processing parameters, different degrees of polymerization are obtained, resulting in hydrated scaffolds of variable swelling and deformation. The 3D hydrogels are biocompatible and promote cell adhesion and migration. Interestingly, according to the polymerization degree, 3D hydrogel woodpile structures show variable extent of cell adhesion and invasion. Human BJ cell lines show capability of deforming 3D micrometric resolved hydrogel structures.},

  abstract = {Two-photon polymerization (2PP) using ultra-short laser pulses is a well-known methodology for the 3D free-form fabrica-tion of optical devices with resolutions down to 100 nm. However, the structure dimensions have been restricted to quite small sizes, mainly due to limitations of the focussing optics and due to very long fabrication times. Therefore, the large-scale fabrication of biomedical scaffold structures with dimensions in the mm-range still remains challenging. Using a diode-pumped Ytterbium laser system emitting 325 fs laser pulses at 515 nm after second harmonic generation we are able to write arbitrary 3D structures in inorganic-organic hybrid polymers (ORMOCER®s). Our setup is able to produce structures with mm extension normal to the substrate at a structural resolution of a few microns. In particular, a 3D porous inner structure can be provided, which is required for three-dimensional cell growth to support cell adhesion and prolifera-tion. Scaffold stru ctures were produced with different parameters, and they were characterized in order to demonstrate their potential concerning resolution and scaffold quality. It is found that not only the experimental setup, but also the substrate material plays an important role for the scaffold fabrication process and structural quality.},

  abstract = {A resonant scanner control system controls a laser source using a pixel clock which uses a voltage controlled oscillator (VCO) and a phase detector to track continuously throughout the entire scan cycle the pixel-to-pixel and cycle-to-cycle operations of the scanner. The clock includes a VCO which changes frequency in a linear manner in response to changes in a frequency-control voltage applied to it. The VCO includes a negative feedback loop which consists of a frequency-to-voltage converter, which converts the VCO output to a related voltage, and a summing/integrating circuit, which compares this voltage with the frequency-control voltage which is produced in response to pixel related control signals and then integrates the difference. The integrated signal drives the VCO, which produces in response an output signal whose frequency varies linearly with variations in the pixel-related frequency-control signal. Once during each scan cycle the phase detector detects any phase error between a pixel-clock-driven synchronization signal and a position-related synchronization signal, which is produced by an optical detector. If the two synchronization signals do not coincide, the phase detector sends an appropriate analog error signal to a multiplying reference port of a multiplying digital/analog converter (DAC) which produces the pixel related frequency-control signal. The DAC then adjusts its frequency-control signal in accordance with the error signal.}

  abstract={A laser scanning microscope produces molecular excitation in a target material by simultaneous absorption of two photons to thereby provide intrinsic three-dimensional resolution. Fluorophores having single photon absorption in the short (ultraviolet or visible) wavelength range are excited by a stream of strongly focused subpicosecond pulses of laser light of relatively long (red or infrared) wavelength range. The fluorophores absorb at about one half the laser wavelength to produce fluorescent images of living cells and other microscopic objects. The fluorescent emission from the fluorophores increases quadratically with the excitation intensity so that by strongly focusing the laser light, fluorescence as well as photobleaching are confined to the vicinity of the focal plane. This feature provides depth of field resolution comparable to that produced by confocal laser scanning microscopes, and in addition reduces photobleaching. Scanning of the laser beam, by a laser scanning microscope, allows construction of images by collecting two- photon excited fluorescence from each point in the scanned object while still satisfying the requirement for very high excitation intensity obtained by focusing the laser beam and by pulse time compressing the beam. The focused pulses also provide three-dimensional spatially resolved photochemistry which is particularly useful in photolytic release of caged effector molecules.}

Femtosecond laser interaction with matter differs essentially from those with longer pulses or CW lasers in its significant nonlinearity, ultrafast characteristics and the possibility of highly localization of reaction volume. These features enable three-dimensional (3D) micro-nanofabrication in solid and liquid media. In two-photon photopolymerization, when a near-infrared femtosecond laser is tightly focused into a photopolymerizable resin, 3D polymer micro-nanostructures are produced by pinpoint photopolymerization of liquid precursory resins. Using this direct laser writing scheme, various photonic, micro-optical components and micromechanical devices have been readily produced. The two-photon photopolymerization technology is expected to play a similar role to that played by lithography for planar semiconductor device processing, but for micro-nanofabrication of 3D polymer-based optoelectronic devices as well for microelectromechanical systems.}
