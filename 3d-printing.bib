  abstract = {Micromachines can be created with higher resolution using two-photon absorption. Compared with light or electron-beam lithography, the virtue of two-photon photopolymerization as a tool for making microdevices lies in its three-dimensional capability, which has found application in photonic devices and micromachines with feature sizes close to the diffraction limit. Here we show that the diffraction limit can be exceeded by non-linear effects to give a subdiffraction-limit spatial resolution of 120 nanometres.}}

  abstract = {Two-photon polymerization (2PP) using ultra-short laser pulses is a well-known methodology for the 3D free-form fabrica-tion of optical devices with resolutions down to 100 nm. However, the structure dimensions have been restricted to quite small sizes, mainly due to limitations of the focussing optics and due to very long fabrication times. Therefore, the large-scale fabrication of biomedical scaffold structures with dimensions in the mm-range still remains challenging. Using a diode-pumped Ytterbium laser system emitting 325 fs laser pulses at 515 nm after second harmonic generation we are able to write arbitrary 3D structures in inorganic-organic hybrid polymers (ORMOCERÂ®s). Our setup is able to produce structures with mm extension normal to the substrate at a structural resolution of a few microns. In particular, a 3D porous inner structure can be provided, which is required for three-dimensional cell growth to support cell adhesion and prolifera-tion. Scaffold stru ctures were produced with different parameters, and they were characterized in order to demonstrate their potential concerning resolution and scaffold quality. It is found that not only the experimental setup, but also the substrate material plays an important role for the scaffold fabrication process and structural quality.},

  abstract = {A resonant scanner control system controls a laser source using a pixel clock which uses a voltage controlled oscillator (VCO) and a phase detector to track continuously throughout the entire scan cycle the pixel-to-pixel and cycle-to-cycle operations of the scanner. The clock includes a VCO which changes frequency in a linear manner in response to changes in a frequency-control voltage applied to it. The VCO includes a negative feedback loop which consists of a frequency-to-voltage converter, which converts the VCO output to a related voltage, and a summing/integrating circuit, which compares this voltage with the frequency-control voltage which is produced in response to pixel related control signals and then integrates the difference. The integrated signal drives the VCO, which produces in response an output signal whose frequency varies linearly with variations in the pixel-related frequency-control signal. Once during each scan cycle the phase detector detects any phase error between a pixel-clock-driven synchronization signal and a position-related synchronization signal, which is produced by an optical detector. If the two synchronization signals do not coincide, the phase detector sends an appropriate analog error signal to a multiplying reference port of a multiplying digital/analog converter (DAC) which produces the pixel related frequency-control signal. The DAC then adjusts its frequency-control signal in accordance with the error signal.}

A new study pushes this technique towards its limits to explore just how far its potential might reach.

Direct laser writing, also called photo-prototyping, is a lithographic technique most commonly used for making the cogs and pulleys of micromachines. It works by 'writing' a desired structure in a photocurable polymer resist, point-by-point, line-by-line and plane-by-plane, by moving a tightly focused laser spot through it.}

  note={US Patent 5,034,613},
  abstract={A laser scanning microscope produces molecular excitation in a target material by simultaneous absorption of two photons to thereby provide intrinsic three-dimensional resolution. Fluorophores having single photon absorption in the short (ultraviolet or visible) wavelength range are excited by a stream of strongly focused subpicosecond pulses of laser light of relatively long (red or infrared) wavelength range. The fluorophores absorb at about one half the laser wavelength to produce fluorescent images of living cells and other microscopic objects. The fluorescent emission from the fluorophores increases quadratically with the excitation intensity so that by strongly focusing the laser light, fluorescence as well as photobleaching are confined to the vicinity of the focal plane. This feature provides depth of field resolution comparable to that produced by confocal laser scanning microscopes, and in addition reduces photobleaching. Scanning of the laser beam, by a laser scanning microscope, allows construction of images by collecting two- photon excited fluorescence from each point in the scanned object while still satisfying the requirement for very high excitation intensity obtained by focusing the laser beam and by pulse time compressing the beam. The focused pulses also provide three-dimensional spatially resolved photochemistry which is particularly useful in photolytic release of caged effector molecules.}

abstract = {This chapter attempts to give an overview of the historical development and current progress of femtosecond laser micro-nanofabrication based on multiphoton absorption, and particular emphasis is placed on two-photon photopolymerization. Femtosecond laser interaction with matter differs essentially from those with longer pulses or CW lasers in its significant nonlinearity, ultrafast characteristics and the possibility of highly localization of reaction volume. These features enable three-dimensional (3D) micro-nanofabrication in solid and liquid media. In two-photon photopolymerization, when a near-infrared femtosecond laser is tightly focused into a photopolymerizable resin, 3D polymer micro-nanostructures are produced by pinpoint photopolymerization of liquid precursory resins. Using this direct laser writing scheme, various photonic, micro-optical components and micromechanical devices have been readily produced. The two-photon photopolymerization technology is expected to play a similar role to that played by lithography for planar semiconductor device processing, but for micro-nanofabrication of 3D polymer-based optoelectronic devices as well for microelectromechanical systems.}
